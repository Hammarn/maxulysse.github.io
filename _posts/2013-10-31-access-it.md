If you missed [this article (in french)](https://bioinfo-fr.net/un-bookmarklet-pour-acceder-plus-facilement-aux-publications) on bioinfo-fr, I will just explain the code, it could be of some help.

Bookmarklets, one click tools, are little scripts stored as URL in a bookmark, or as an hyperlink in a web page (cf [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet)). Coded in JavaScript, they add new functionnalies, and can even call more complex scripts, stored somewhere else.

The code here is very simple :
<script src="https://gist.github.com/MaxUlysse/6218598.js"></script>

javascript: The language used for writing the bookmarklet.

function() Call an anonymous function in JavaScript.

location.hostname=location.hostname+'.urlproxy'; The interesting part : It adds at the end of the domain name (location.hostname) the proxyâ€™s URL, wich automatically change the URL of the page on wich you activate the bookmarklet.

If you get a 404 error. It means that the proxy was not planned for the visited site. Wich could happen if you click twice on the bookmarklet.
