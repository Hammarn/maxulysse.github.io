## Hello world!
I was beginning tired of Wordpress, so I decided to try out Jekyll hosted on Github, and I'm quite happy with the result.

If you want to know more about the template I'm using, you can look at the [github repository](https://github.com/maxulysse/maxulysse.github.io).

I kind of like the philosophy of using such a tool. I remind me a lot of LaTeX in fact.

And I do like the possibility to write easilly in markdown.
